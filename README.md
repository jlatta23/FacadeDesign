# Facade Design Tool - JR Latta
3D Facade Design Tool - From Idea to Execution. Realtime Rendering, Material Optimizations, Generate Revit Object
This is a page to discuss the design tool I built for a facade fabrication company.

## Background
The current workflow for building facade design is:

* Architect sketches facade elevations in CAD / BIM modeling software
* Architect talks to manufacturer about their specific project
* Architect sends over CAD file to fabricator for price estimate and feedback
* Manufacturer sends architect samples of the materials
* Fabricator calculates material optimization and pricing estimate
* Architect uses this to adjust their design
* Repeat until the design matches aesthetics and price

My Facade Design Tool gives architects the power to design this.
* Architect designs their project using design tool
